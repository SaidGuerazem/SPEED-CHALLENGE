# Spacecraft Pose Estimation

This repository contains code for estimating the pose of a spacecraft from grayscale images using the SPEED Dataset provided by the European Space Agency (ESA).

## Project Overview

The Spacecraft Pose Estimation project aims to estimate the relative pose (distance and orientation) of a spacecraft from pixel images only. The project utilizes the SPEED Dataset, which features images and poses of the Tango spacecraft from the PRISMA mission, generated by SLAB's Optical Simulator and the TRON facility.

## Dataset Details

- **SPEED Dataset**: The official dataset of ESA's Kelvins "Pose Estimation Challenge" features 12,000 images from SLAB's Optical Simulator and 300 images from the TRON facility. It includes high-fidelity texture models and physical mock-up models of the Tango spacecraft.

## Model Architecture

- **Feature Extractor**: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to extract high-level features from grayscale spacecraft images.
- **Pose Estimation Layer**: A fully connected layer is added on top of the ResNet-50 base model to estimate the spacecraft's pose from the extracted features.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning techniques were applied to fine-tune the pre-trained ResNet-50 model for spacecraft pose estimation tasks, demonstrating satisfactory performance.

## Reference

The SPEED Dataset is the official dataset of ESA's Kelvins "Pose Estimation Challenge" in collaboration with Stanford University's Space Rendezvous Lab (SLAB). For more information, visit [ESA Kelvins Challenge](https://kelvins.esa.int/satellite-pose-estimation-challenge/)
